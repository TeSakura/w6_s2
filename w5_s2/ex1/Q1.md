In this three scenarios i think Using a Dedicated Function is more advantage then the other another cuz:

. Improves readability by separating widget-building logic from the widget tree.
. Encourages reusabilityâ€”dedicated functions can be called in different parts of the app.
. Easier to test and debug, as the logic resides in a separate method.
. Best for complex widget creation logic or scenarios requiring reusability.
